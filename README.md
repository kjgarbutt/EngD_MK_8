# EngD_MK_8

This is a fairly large change from MK_7, with a different structure
It is still adapted from the MASON demo, "Gridlock", made by Sarah Wise,
Mark Coletti, and Andrew Crooks.

The model reads a number of GIS shapefiles and displays a road network, two  Environment Agency
flood maps and a bespoke Open Source Vulnerability Index (OSVI).
The model reads in a .CSV and generates a predetermined number of agents with set  characteristics.
The agents are placed on the road network and are located at  a Red Cross office.
The model reads a separate .CSV and assigns goal locations to   each agent at random from a 
predetermined list.
The agents are assigned speeds at  random. 
Once the model is started, the agents move from A to B, then they change direction 
and head back to their start position. The process repeats until the user quits.
